# React Trello clone.

# To run it - simply clone a repository and run npm start after installing npm. Project will be deployed soon.

## My newest project which I'm creating with a use of Redux toolkit to learn it in practice. It is also written in Typescript to improve my capability of using it in applications.

### My Trello looks very familiar to the original one, I'm trying my best in stylesheets to make it look as nice as possible. Registering in, creating a workspace, creating a boards in workspaces, creating columns with tasks. It is also my first touch with drag and drop which will be implemented in project just like in the original.
